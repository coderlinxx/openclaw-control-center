# OpenClaw Control Center

<img src="docs/assets/overview-hero-en.png" alt="OpenClaw Control Center overview hero screenshot" width="1200" />

Safety-first local control center for OpenClaw.

Language: **English** | [中文](README.md)

## Why this exists
- One local place to see whether OpenClaw is healthy, busy, blocked, or drifting.
- Built for non-technical operators who need observability and certainty, not raw backend payloads.
- Safe first-run defaults:
  - read-only by default
  - local token auth by default
  - mutation routes disabled by default

## What you get
- `Overview`: health, current state, decisions waiting, and operator-facing summaries
- `Usage`: usage, spend, subscription windows, and connector status
- `Staff`: who is really working now versus only queued
- `Tasks`: current work, approvals, execution chains, and runtime evidence
- `Documents` and `Memory`: source-backed workbenches scoped to active OpenClaw agents

## Who it is for
- OpenClaw users who want one local control center for observability, usage, tasks, approvals, replay, documents, and memory
- teams running OpenClaw on one machine or a reachable local environment
- maintainers who want a public-ready, safety-first OpenClaw dashboard instead of a generic agent platform

## Section-by-section tour

### Overview
- The main operating screen for non-technical users.
- Shows the current control posture, key action items, runtime issues, stalled runs, budget risk, who is active, and what needs attention first.
- Best when you want one fast answer to: “Is OpenClaw okay right now?”

### Usage
- Shows today, 7-day, and 30-day usage and spend trends.
- Includes subscription windows, quota consumption, usage mix, and connector status.
- Best when you want to know whether spend or quota is becoming risky.

### Staff
- Shows who is truly active now versus who only has queued work.
- Separates live work from “next up” so backlog is not confused with active execution.
- Best when you want to know who is busy, idle, blocked, or waiting.

### Memory
- A source-backed workbench for daily and long-term memory files.
- Scoped to active OpenClaw agents from `openclaw.json`, so deleted agents do not keep showing up.
- Best when you want to inspect or edit memory that the current OpenClaw team is actually using.

### Documents
- A source-backed workbench for shared and agent-specific core markdown docs.
- Reads the real source files and writes back to the same files.
- Best when you want to maintain the actual working documents behind the system.

### Tasks
- Combines task board, schedule, approvals, execution chains, and runtime evidence.
- Helps distinguish mapped work from real execution evidence, and shows what is blocked or needs review.
- Best when you want to understand what is being carried, what is only planned, and what needs intervention.

### Settings
- Shows safety mode, connector status, and data-link expectations.
- Makes it clear what is connected, what is still partial, and which high-risk actions are intentionally disabled.
- Best when you want to verify environment setup or explain why a signal is missing.

For:
- Existing OpenClaw users who want a local control center for observability, usage, staff activity, tasks, approvals, replay, and documents.
- Teams running OpenClaw on the same machine or a reachable local environment.
- Not a generic dashboard for non-OpenClaw agent stacks.

## Core constraints
- Only touches files in `control-center/`.
- `READONLY_MODE=true` by default.
- `LOCAL_TOKEN_AUTH_REQUIRED=true` by default.
- `IMPORT_MUTATION_ENABLED=false` by default.
- `IMPORT_MUTATION_DRY_RUN=false` by default.
- Import/export and all state-changing endpoints require a local token when auth is enabled.
- Approval actions are hard-gated (`APPROVAL_ACTIONS_ENABLED=false` default).
- Approval actions are dry-run by default (`APPROVAL_ACTIONS_DRY_RUN=true`).
- No mutation of `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`.

## Quick start
1. `npm install`
2. `cp .env.example .env`
3. Keep safe defaults for the first run; only change `GATEWAY_URL` or path overrides if your OpenClaw setup is non-standard.
4. `npm run build`
5. `npm test`
6. `npm run smoke:ui`
7. `UI_MODE=true npm run dev`

## Installation and onboarding

### 1. Before you start
You should already have:
- a working OpenClaw installation
- a reachable OpenClaw Gateway
- shell access with `node` and `npm`
- read access to your OpenClaw home directory

For the richest dashboard data, it also helps if this machine has:
- `~/.openclaw`
- `~/.codex`
- a readable OpenClaw subscription snapshot, if your setup stores one outside the default locations

### 2. Install the project
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd control-center
npm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### 3. Recommended default: let your own OpenClaw do the install and setup
The best first-run path is not manual setup. The best path is to give your own OpenClaw one installation prompt and let it do the safe wiring for you.

It should handle:
- environment checks
- dependency install
- `.env` creation or correction
- safe first-run defaults
- `build / test / smoke`
- a final summary of what to run and what to open

Give OpenClaw this full prompt:

```text
You are installing and connecting OpenClaw Control Center to this machine's OpenClaw environment.

Your goal is not to explain theory. Your goal is to complete a safe first-run setup end to end.

Hard rules:
1. Work only inside the control-center repository.
2. Do not modify application source code unless I explicitly ask.
3. Do not modify OpenClaw's own config files.
4. Do not enable live import or approval mutations.
5. Keep all high-risk write paths disabled.

Follow this order:

Phase 1: inspect the environment
1. Check whether the OpenClaw Gateway is reachable and confirm the correct `GATEWAY_URL`.
2. Confirm the correct `OPENCLAW_HOME` and `CODEX_HOME` on this machine.
3. If the subscription or billing snapshot is stored outside the default path, find the correct `OPENCLAW_SUBSCRIPTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH`.
4. If any required path, process, or file is missing, stop and tell me exactly what is missing instead of guessing.

Phase 2: install the project
5. Confirm that the current directory is the control-center repo root.
6. Install dependencies.
7. If `.env` does not exist, create it from `.env.example`. If it already exists, update it while preserving safe first-run defaults.

Phase 3: apply safe first-run settings
8. Keep these values:
   - READONLY_MODE=true
   - LOCAL_TOKEN_AUTH_REQUIRED=true
   - APPROVAL_ACTIONS_ENABLED=false
   - APPROVAL_ACTIONS_DRY_RUN=true
   - IMPORT_MUTATION_ENABLED=false
   - IMPORT_MUTATION_DRY_RUN=false
   - UI_MODE=false
9. Only change these when the machine actually requires it:
   - GATEWAY_URL
   - OPENCLAW_HOME
   - CODEX_HOME
   - OPENCLAW_SUBSCRIPTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH
   - UI_PORT

Phase 4: verify the install
10. Run:
   - npm run build
   - npm test
   - npm run smoke:ui
11. If any step fails, stop and tell me:
   - which step failed
   - why it failed
   - what I should do next

Phase 5: hand off a ready-to-run result
12. If verification passes, print:
   - which env values you changed
   - which env values stayed on the defaults
   - the exact command I should run next to launch the UI
   - the first 3 dashboard pages I should open
   - which missing signals are normal for a partially connected environment

Format your final answer as:
- Environment check
- Actual changes
- Verification result
- Next command
- First pages to open
```

### 4. If you want to configure `.env` manually
Only use this path if you do not want OpenClaw to handle setup for you.

For a safe first run, keep the mutation guards in place.

Use this baseline:
```dotenv
GATEWAY_URL=ws://127.0.0.1:18789
READONLY_MODE=true
APPROVAL_ACTIONS_ENABLED=false
APPROVAL_ACTIONS_DRY_RUN=true
IMPORT_MUTATION_ENABLED=false
IMPORT_MUTATION_DRY_RUN=false
LOCAL_TOKEN_AUTH_REQUIRED=true
UI_MODE=false
UI_PORT=4310

# Optional only when your paths differ from the defaults:
# OPENCLAW_HOME=/path/to/.openclaw
# CODEX_HOME=/path/to/.codex
# OPENCLAW_SUBSCRIPTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH=/path/to/subscription.json
```

Change only these values if your environment needs it:
- `GATEWAY_URL`: when your OpenClaw Gateway is not on the default local socket
- `OPENCLAW_HOME`: when OpenClaw is not stored in `~/.openclaw`
- `CODEX_HOME`: when Codex data is not stored in `~/.codex`
- `OPENCLAW_SUBSCRIPTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH`: when your billing/subscription snapshot lives somewhere custom
- `UI_PORT`: when `4310` is already in use

### 5. Verify the install
Run:
```bash
npm run build
npm test
npm run smoke:ui
```

Expected result:
- build passes
- tests pass
- UI smoke reports a local URL such as `http://127.0.0.1:<port>`

### 6. Start the UI
```bash
UI_MODE=true npm run dev
```

Then open:
- English UI: `http://127.0.0.1:4310/?section=overview&lang=en`
- Chinese UI: `http://127.0.0.1:4310/?section=overview&lang=zh`

If you changed `UI_PORT`, replace `4310` with your chosen port.

### 7. First-use checklist
On your first launch, check these pages in order:
1. `Overview`: the app opens and shows current system state.
2. `Usage`: usage and subscription panels either show real numbers or a clear missing-connector state.
3. `Staff`: live work status matches real active sessions.
4. `Tasks`: current work, approvals, and execution-chain cards load without raw payload noise.
5. `Documents` and `Memory`: the visible agent tabs match your active agents from `openclaw.json`.

### 8. If something looks wrong
- Empty live activity usually means `GATEWAY_URL` is wrong or the OpenClaw Gateway is not running.
- Missing `Documents / Memory` agents usually means `OPENCLAW_HOME` points to the wrong OpenClaw root or `openclaw.json` is missing.
- Missing usage/subscription data usually means `CODEX_HOME` or `OPENCLAW_SUBSCRIPTION_SNAPSHOT_PATH` needs to be set.
- If you only want a safe read-only dashboard, do not change the mutation defaults.

## Local commands
- `npm run build`
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run dev:continuous`
- `npm run dev:ui`
- `npm run smoke:ui`
- `npm run command:backup-export`
- `npm run command:import-validate -- runtime/exports/<file>.json`
- `npm run command:acks-prune`
- `npm test`
- `npm run validate`

For protected command modes (`command:backup-export`, `command:import-validate`, `command:acks-prune`), set `LOCAL_API_TOKEN=<token>` unless `LOCAL_TOKEN_AUTH_REQUIRED=false`.

## Maintainer publishing notes
If you are publishing the repository itself, not just installing it, use this section. Normal operators can skip it.

- Run `npm run release:audit` before public pushes
- See [`docs/PUBLISHING.md`](docs/PUBLISHING.md) for the standalone repo release flow

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 14)
- Home page includes inline scoped search UI wired to `/api/search/*`.
- Home page replay/export visibility card now shows returned/filtered counts and latency/size indicators from `/api/replay/index`.
- Guard table shows explicit disabled/enabled badges and linked local docs references.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 107, Approvals/replay/tool-activity correctness sweep)
- Approval counts now use the full live approval set:
  - sidebar and task-hub decision counts no longer under-report when approval previews are truncated
  - approval preview lists stay short but now make it explicit when only the latest subset is shown
- Replay visibility chips now show total available history:
  - timeline events
  - daily digests
  - export snapshots
  - backup bundles
- Overview tool activity detail now loads actual session evidence:
  - it no longer claims there are no tool-call sessions while the same page shows active tool-call counts
- User-facing parity routes no longer advertise deprecated dashboard sections:
  - approvals route points to the task hub decision lane
  - replay route points to `/audit`

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 110, Docs/memory active-agent scope alignment)
- `Documents` and `Memory` now follow active OpenClaw agent config instead of stale workspace folders:
  - facets are resolved from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` first
  - removed agents no longer appear just because an old folder still exists under `workspace/agents/`
  - root OpenClaw files are now shown as `Main` instead of `共享`
- Editable file content remains source-of-truth current:
  - file lists still read live filesystem metadata (`updatedAt`, size, path)
  - opening a file reads the current source file
  - saving a file writes directly back to that same source file

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 111, Execution-chain readability cleanup)
- `Execution chain` cards no longer surface raw JSON payloads as the visible headline or summary.
- Unmapped isolated-run cards now use stable labels such as `Main · Cron 隔离执行`.
- JSON-like payloads are summarized into short readable lines:
  - `成功 · 查询 30 · 成功 30`
  - `失败 · 错误 locked`
  - `成功 · 扫描 120 · 入选 2 · 发送 2`
- Long titles and session keys now wrap/clamp inside the card instead of pushing badges out of place.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 112, Staff status freshness semantics)
- Staff `Working / 工作中` now means live execution, not just “still owns unfinished tasks”.
- Agents with backlog but no live session now stay in standby semantics instead of looking falsely active.
- Staff work labels now separate:
  - live work: `Working on / 正在处理什么`
  - queued next task: `Next up / 下一项`
- Staff/recent-activity cache remains short-lived at about `3s`; live-session polling baseline remains `5s`.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 114, Execution-chain card hardening)
- Execution-chain cards no longer allow raw JSON-like payloads to become visible titles.
- Structured payload-shaped titles are converted into short human summaries or stable fallback labels instead.
- Long titles, meta rows, and badge rails are now overflow-safe inside the card grid.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 115, Apple-native card elevation tune)
- Page canvas is slightly cooler and quieter so foreground cards stand out more cleanly.
- Core cards now use brighter layered fills, crisper borders, and deeper but still restrained elevation.
- The hierarchy is unchanged; this is a visual polish pass, not a layout rewrite.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 116, Config-truthful document and memory scopes)
- `Documents / Memory` no longer revive deleted agents just because stale folders still remain on disk.
- Valid active-agent config remains the only truth source for those facet buttons.
- If config becomes unreadable, the workbench now falls back conservatively to `Main` only instead of showing stale agent folders.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 106, Cold-path cache coalescing)
- Correctness stays unified across Overview / Settings / Usage:
  - no return to split summary/full quota logic
  - repeat navigations keep the same usage/quota truth when the underlying execution state is unchanged
- Heavy evidence scans are now reused instead of recomputed per page:
  - runtime usage logs
  - Codex subscription/quota telemetry
  - digest history
  - OpenClaw cron name catalog
- UI startup now primes dashboard caches, and concurrent page opens share the same heavy build work.
- In local smoke:
  - back-to-back `Overview` renders dropped to about `0.41s`
  - back-to-back `Usage` renders dropped to about `0.41s`
  - after one priming hit, concurrent `Overview / Settings / Usage` completed in about `1.13s`

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 105, Observability correctness alignment)
- Overview / Tasks / Settings / Usage now share one usage/quota truth source:
  - the same today-usage number
  - the same Codex quota windows
  - the same subscription-status judgement
- Active-session counts are aligned across:
  - overview KPI
  - certainty card
  - sidebar / summary strips
- Task certainty no longer depends on only the first recent-session page:
  - linked session evidence is loaded for the visible task set
  - task detail pages no longer stop at the first 6 linked sessions
- Detail links now keep the current UI language when opening task / cron drill-down pages.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 15, UX v2)
- Home dashboard is now organized into six operator tabs with persistent left navigation:
  - `Overview`
  - `Office Space`
  - `Projects/Tasks`
  - `Alerts`
  - `Replay/Audit`
  - `Settings`
- UI moved to a colorful pixel-arcade visual style with dual sidebars (navigation + context rail).
- New `Office Space` view shows who is busy on what, grouped by office zones.
- Agent cards now include automatic animal identities derived from agent name semantics, with deterministic fallback mapping.
- Empty/zero-heavy blocks are softened:
  - non-actionable zero states are minimized
  - user-facing empty states now say `Not activated yet`.
- Home copy was rewritten from debug-heavy wording to operator-focused language while preserving all existing routes and backend behavior.

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 22, Usage/Cost parity surfaces)
- Added `Usage & Cost` section in the primary sidebar IA.
- Added Overview card-level usage/cost pulse:
  - period totals (`today`, `7d`, `30d`)
  - request-count source state
  - burn-rate headline
- Added dedicated Usage & Cost dashboard section:
  - context window visibility per active session/agent (absolute tokens + % when context catalog is available)
  - pace/trend labels + warning thresholds
  - usage/cost breakdown by agent, project, model, provider
  - budget burn-rate status and alert messaging
- Added graceful unavailable-state behavior:
  - explicit `Data source not connected` labels for disconnected metrics (instead of fake zeros)
  - connector TODO list surfaced in Settings
- Added usage adapter endpoint:
  - `GET /api/usage-cost`

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 25, Mission Control v3)
- UI visual reset to polished pixel-office style:
  - design-token based palette/spacing/radius/shadow system
  - layered office background grid + glow depth
  - responsive desktop/mobile hierarchy with subtle card/status motion
- Navigation and copy reset for operator clarity:
  - `Command Deck`, `Usage & Billing`, `Pixel Office`, `Work Board`, `Decisions`, `Timeline`, `Control Room`
  - reduced technical wording on primary surfaces
  - advanced links preserved under explicit disclosure
- Mac parity surfaces panel added with status + route entry for:
  - conversations, approvals/decision queue, cron, projects/tasks, usage/cost, replay/audit, health/digest, export/import dry-run safety, pixel adapter
- Full roster office model:
  - best-effort OpenClaw roster read from `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` via `src/runtime/agent-roster.ts`
  - office floor now renders desk/zone occupancy and includes known agents beyond active sessions
- Subscription usage/remaining best-effort integration:
  - adapter support in `src/runtime/usage-cost.ts` for connected/partial/not_connected states
  - UI now shows consumed/remaining/limit/cycle/source and explicit connection targets when unavailable

## Dashboard highlights (Phase 68, Plain-language certainty)
- Added `Information certainty` card to Overview and Settings:
  - tells non-technical operators which parts of the picture are trustworthy now
  - calls out remaining blind spots in plain language
- Added `Execution certainty` board to Tasks:
  - scores whether each in-flight task is backed by real execution evidence
  - separates `evidence is strong` from `needs follow-up` and `evidence is weak`
- Task detail pages now act as evidence pages:
  - certainty judgement
  - linked session evidence and recent activity summaries

## API validation/error envelope
- API mutating routes require `Content-Type: application/json`.
- Import/export and mutating routes require local token auth by default:
  - header: `x-local-token: <LOCAL_API_TOKEN>`
  - or `Authorization: Bearer <LOCAL_API_TOKEN>`
- Strict API query validation rejects unknown query keys.
- JSON errors use a consistent envelope:
  - `{"ok":false,"requestId":"...","error":{"code":"...","status":<http>,"message":"...","issues":[],"requestId":"..."}}`
- JSON responses include `requestId` and all responses include `x-request-id` header for correlation.

## Live import warning
- `POST /api/import/live` is intentionally disabled by default.
- Do not enable it unless you are doing a controlled local restore test.
- Live mode mutates local runtime stores (`runtime/projects.json`, `runtime/tasks.json`, `runtime/budgets.json`).
- Keep `READONLY_MODE=true` and `IMPORT_MUTATION_ENABLED=false` in normal operation.

## Runtime files
- `runtime/last-snapshot.json`
- `runtime/timeline.log`
- `runtime/projects.json`
- `runtime/tasks.json`
- `runtime/budgets.json`
- `runtime/notification-policy.json`
- `runtime/model-context-catalog.json`
